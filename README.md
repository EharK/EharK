## 🎓A Quick Intro: 
I earned my stripes as a computer science graduate from the esteemed University of Tartu. Presently, I hold the role of a Full Stack Engineer at Avokaado.io, where my daily endeavors revolve around the intricate art of coding and crafting innovative solutions.

## 🏆My Work Highlights: 
In 2021, I secured third place in a data science project on autonomous car data visualization.📈
I've developed a user-friendly Python module for Open-EID card readers and created a crypto market research plugin (coming soon winky face). I've also built a ChatGPT-integrated web app and a calendar event planner from scratch. Code magic! 💡

## 💻My Tech Skills:
I work with Java, Python, JavaScript, Vue.js and a bunch of other tools. Git, PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA – you name it, I've probably used it.
…and the obvious stuff:
HTML, CSS, SQL etc.


## 🎵Beyond Work: 

I'm a firm believer in a well-rounded life. I embrace the tranquility of music, particularly the piano and the guitar. Music is my creative outlet. 
I've also got a soft spot for photography and video/photo editing.
