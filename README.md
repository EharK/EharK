In 2021, I secured third place in a data science project on autonomous car data visualization.📈
I've developed a user-friendly Python module for Open-EID card readers and created a crypto market research plugin <a href="http://www.sirbofi.com">Sir Bofi</a>. I've also built a ChatGPT-integrated web app, calendar event planner from scratch, CLI arrow navigated menu module, automated business transactions through clustered API services, and so on. Code magic! 💡
